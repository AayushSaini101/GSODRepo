Moja global Developer Documentation
===================================

Moja global provides tools for estimating emissions and removals of greenhouse gases from the land sector.

FLINT: The Full Lands Integration Tool (FLINT) is the flagship software developed by the moja global community. It is an integrating platform for estimating land-based greenhouse gas emissions and removals. Integrating refers to FLINTâ€™s 
design to combine a wide range of data with models to achieve more accurate estimates of stocks and fluxes of greenhouse gases. FLINT is consistent with the UNFCCC guidelines.
